### IoT-based and malware-based attacks are increasingly targeting Critical Infrastructure

* The `malware_project.ipynb` file contains the analysis performed on the MalMem2022 dataset.
* The `creating-a-smaller-dataset-for-ciciot2023.ipynb` is primarily built to reduce the size of the CICIot2023 dataset which is 13 GBs in size.
* This could be helpful in performing analysis on the dataset for example Feature Engineering, Variance and Corelation analysis, Feature Selection etc.
* The `iot_project.ipynb` file contains analysis performed on the CICIot2023 dataset, the feature engineering has been performed a simpler subset of the CICIot2023 dataset.
* The notebooks assume that the [Obfuscated-MalMem2022.csv](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2022.html) file and the [CICIoT2023](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iotdataset-2023.html) directory as extacted from the zip format containing all the parts of the complete CICIoT2023 dataset are both present in the working directory of this project.
* If this is not the case, please specify the paths to these files.
